## Description

"What to Watch" is a web application that simplifies the process of searching for movies and customizing the information displayed according to the user's interests.

The motivation behind this project was to provide users with a comprehensive movie search experience, where they can easily find, review, and pin their desired categories of movie information. By leveraging multiple APIs, such as OMDB, TMDB, New York Times, and Streaming Availability, users can explore detailed movie data and discover where movies are available to stream or rent.

"What to Watch" sets itself apart by offering an intuitive interface with the following key features:

- Dynamic movie card display based on user searches.
- The ability to customize displayed movie information.
- Persistent storage for search history and user configurations.
- Genre-based movie selection from a dropdown menu.
- Pinned movie cards that remain visible even after page refresh.

## API Calls

The user story of searching for desired movie information involves several API calls:

1. An initial call to the OMDB API with the movie title to retrieve a list of relevant movies.
2. Handling duplicates and, if necessary, prompting the user to select the year of the movie.
3. A second call to OMDB with the selected title and year.
4. A call to the TMDB API for additional movie data.
5. Using the NYT API to fetch the appropriate review.
6. Using the Streaming Availability API to check where the movie is available to stream, rent, or buy.

Only the information that the user selects is displayed.

## Description of CSS Framework Tailwind

Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, was used to style the "What to Watch" web application. It streamlines the styling process by providing a set of pre-defined classes for consistent and visually appealing user interface components.
